= Styles and Themes

Styles and themes on Android allow you to separate the details of your app design from the UI
structure and behavior, similar to stylesheets in web design.

A style is a collection of attributes that specify the appearance for a single View.
A style can specify attributes such as font color, font size, background color, and much more.

A theme is a type of style that's applied to an entire app, activity, or view hierarchyâ€”not just an
individual view. When you apply your style as a theme, every view in the app or activity applies
each style attribute that it supports. Themes can also apply styles to non-view elements, such as
the status bar and window background.

Styles and themes are declared in a style resource file in `res/values/`, usually named `styles.xml`.

== Build variants

Each applications use the https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants[_flavor_]
concept at the build gradle level which allows to easily create variants of these applications.
Currently, the default variant is `pnx` which allows you to apply, among other things, the basic
colors of the theme and the icons of the mobile applications following the main colors of the French
National Park. When building applications, it is therefore necessary to specify the variant to be
used by gradle:

In `debug` mode:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean assemblePnxDebug
----

== How to register a new build variant

You have to modify each `build.gradle` file located in each application directory and add a new
variant to `productFlavors`. For example, if you want to create the named `pnm` we'll get:

[source,gradle]
----
android {
    ...
    productFlavors {
        pnx {
        }
        pne {
        }
        pnv {
        }
        pnm {
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

When building applications, it will be necessary to specify the variant to be used by gradle.

In `debug` mode:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean assemblePnmDebug
----

== Adding a color theme

Once the buildvariant has been created, you now need to add a new directory with the same name as
this variant in the `src/` directory of each application:

* `main`: the directory of resources and sources for each application
* `pnm`: The directory for the `pnm` variant.

Copy the `res/values/colors.xml` from an existing variant (e.g. `pne`) to the directory of the new
variant:

* `primary`: the primary color of the theme
* `primary_dark`: the dark variant of the theme's main color
* `accent`: accent color
